This Repository is of a project in CS522: Social Computing at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar.
Faculty: Dr Sudarshan Iyengar

In this Project, We are assigned to run a random walk on Wikipedia using publically available wikidump and try to find some 
interesting observations from the random-walk. Running random-walk will give us the page-rank of all the web pages on 
wikipedia similiar to google pagerank algorithm.

Run Code.py and enter the bz2 file name.It takes ~2.5 Hours to make Adjaceny_list ( ~4.32 GB ) and then take additional 
~1.5 Hour to compute PageRank of the respective wikipedia dump.

Some of my finding are in Findings.txt , do check it out for interesting facts.

Wikipedia Dumps can be downloaded from : https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/20221220/
